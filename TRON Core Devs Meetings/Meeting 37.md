* Progress of [Proposal: Reduce TRX block rewards](https://github.com/tronprotocol/tips/issues/738)
* Hard fork proposals plan

## Details

* Jake

  OK, let's stop waiting for them and start. There are two topics for today. One is the discussion about the reduction of block rewards, and the other is the discussion about the opening of several proposals in 4.8.0.

  Let's start with the discussion about the reduction of TRX rewards first. Wayne, could you briefly introduce it and share your screen?

**Progress of Proposal: Reduce TRX block rewards**

* Wayne

  Can everyone see it? Okay, I'll start. 

  Now, let me share my opinion first. Personally, the amount of TRX and its production have a great impact on the income of stakers. I think that even if the TRX reward is reduced by 50%, the annual minting volume will only be reduced by 800 million, right? That is, it will be reduced by 0.84% of the total supply every year. This should have a small impact on its price. However, for developers in the community or holders of third-party projects who want to obtain income by staking TRX, the loss is relatively large. In fact, this proposal will bring a loss of income to ordinary TRX stakers, but the price of TRX does not increase, right?
  
  The price of TRX is controlled by some large holders, to some extent, it can be said to be artificial. In fact, everyone can check the price increase of all the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Basically, all cryptocurrencies have increased by 12%-15 %, but the increase of TRX is relatively small, only 3%-4 %. In this case, no one is really interested in buying TRX, because there are always some people in the TRON community who put forward such controversial, absurd and ordinary - user - interest - harming proposals, and then do whatever makes them the most profit. On the contrary, it will cause some losses to TRX holders.

  If we want to reduce the reward by 50%, should we first try to increase the price by 75%, observe the market situation, and then check the price after one month before reducing the reward?

* Jake

  To sum up, your point is that if we want to reduce the reward, we should wait until the price of TRX increases and observe the market situation before making a decision.

* Leem

  Because it was said just now that the price may not be affected much, because some large holders control most of the circulating TRX. So I want to ask, what is the approximate proportion they control? Is there any data?

* Murphy

  The TRX controlled by the TRON DAO has been fully unlocked and entered circulation. Its decentralization is relatively mature. So we don't know exactly how much is controlled by some individuals or large holders. The circulation of TRX has been completely community-based.

* Leem

  Just now, Wayne said that the reduction of TRX production will not have much impact on its price because he said that some people control its price. So, who is actually controlling this price? If no one controls it, the reduction of TRX production will cause deflation, and theoretically, the price should rise.

* Murphy

  Yes. Anyway, judging from the data of other chains, deflation will definitely lead to a price increase in the long run. Bitcoin is a typical example. However, there are many factors that can affect the short-term price fluctuation of the currency, such as market hotspots and user sentiment. So my view is that there may be short-term fluctuations and impacts, but in the long run, deflation will have a certain positive effect on the rise of the currency price.

* Leem

  I also think his view is not very accurate. This proposal actually has a great impact on SR. Do they have any feedback?

* Lucas

  Currently, the deflation rate is 0.181%. If the reward is reduced to 50%, the deflation rate will almost double to about 1.78%. This is quite a high number, and it is said that this situation will continue in the next four or five years. Compared with other public chains, even a 50% reduction is reasonable. As Murphy said, the short-term price is determined by many factors, but the long-term price can be predicted to rise. In short, I think this proposal is to encourage users to stake. Although the short-term price change of TRX is complex, from the perspective of deflation, it will still be bullish in the long run. Considering that the current annualized yield of cost-effective staking exceeds 9%, even if the supply of TRX decreases by 50%, compared with other chains, TRX is still attractive. This is my view.

* Wayne

  I have a question. If the reward is reduced, can it really increase the staking rate? For example, in our daily life, if a bank reduces the deposit interest rate from 5% to 2.5%, normally, not many people will continue to invest money in it.

* Allen

  I don't think it can be compared in this way. Due to the mechanism of TRON, in addition to burning TRX, users can also use the resources obtained by staking TRX to pay transaction fees. Therefore, if the supply of TRX decreases, TRX will become more valuable, and users are more likely to prefer to use resources with lower costs. In addition, because the total amount of resources is limited, users are encouraged to stake more TRX to obtain sufficient resources. So we can't use the bank interest to make an analogy here. First of all, the income of TRON staking includes block rewards, voting rewards, and resource leasing rewards. As far as I know, the total annualized yield is about 9%, of which block rewards and voting rewards account for 4.5%. Then the resource leasing reward accounts for about 5%, which is still very competitive compared with other chains and other mainstream chains. Even if the supply decreases by 50%, the block rewards and voting rewards will only be about 2.2 percentage points. However, with the increase in the value of resources, the resource leasing reward may be higher, which can offset the decrease in profit. Even if the total annualized yield reaches 7.2%, it is still attractive enough compared with other banks.

* Jake

  What do you all think about Allen and Lucas's views?

* Wayne

  The staking reward is not a characteristic of the TRON blockchain like the voting reward. Shouldn't this amount be included in the calculation? And some large holders lease energy on Justlend, which will also cause some losses to the holders of TRX, right?

* Daniel

  Not necessarily. The energy leasing market is definitely a very important part of the TRON ecosystem, and this market is also very active. There are many third-party DAPPs and third-party energy providers that are filling the entire TRON ecosystem through energy leasing and energy agencies. Do you have any specific data to support the situation you mentioned?

* Wayne

  This is just my opinion. I don't have any data.

* Jake

  Overall, from Allen's speech just now, there is a calculation of the overall income. Reducing TRX should have little impact on the income of retail investors in the long run, but this is also calculated based on the data. Does anyone have any other ideas or concerns?

* Murphy

  Just now, Leem seemed to ask if SR had any reaction to the reduction of block rewards. Currently, the community hasn't received any feedback from SR. Maybe it's because more than 95% of SR's income is distributed back to the users who voted for them, so there is really no feedback at the moment.

* Jake

  I'll interject briefly. Currently, there is approximately one SR who is concerned about this issue, but he is also waiting to see the result of the community discussion and has not expressed his own opinion. This is the general situation with SR.

  If there are no other opinions, let's move on.

**Hard Folk Proposals Plan**

* Murphy

  Let me talk about the hard fork plan and the reasons for it. Actually, this topic was mentioned at the last developer meeting. At that time, we just wanted everyone to take a look at the plan for opening the proposals in 4.8.0, that is, to see which proposal should be opened first, which one later, or if they could be opened together. The result of the discussion at that meeting was that these proposals are independent of each other, and it doesn't matter which one is opened first or later. So this time, we hope to decide whether these proposals will be opened together or what the opening sequence is, and also include the opening time, etc. The community hopes that the relevant proposals will be posted on GitHub this week.

  If everyone has no objections, since these three proposals, two of which are related to virtual machine instructions and one is related to consensus layer verification, are all relatively technical underlying proposals. So, if there are no objections, our conclusion is to recommend opening these three proposals together. Does anyone have any objections? If not, we will open them together, and then we will also synchronize with the testing team on Nile for testing at that time.

* Jake

  Should the authors of the three proposals be at the meeting?

* Murphy

  I have contacted the authors of these proposals this week. The proposals will be released this week. Then we will review the progress of the opening of these proposals together at the next meeting, which is around the end of May.

* Jake

  Okay, does anyone have any other questions to discuss?

* Wayne

  Yes. Previously, the TRON DAO illegally added 10 billion TRX to the supply that should have been destroyed for USDD. In fact, this is the reason for wanting to reduce the rewards this time, which is to combat inflation. Because of this behavior, no one in the US government, which supports cryptocurrencies, takes TRX seriously. And any TRX holder who stakes TRX and receives rewards will not actively ask for a reduction in rewards, right? This is the case whether from the perspective of developers or TRX holders.

* Allen

  This issue has been explained many times. Let me explain it again. During the operation of the old USDD, that is, USDDOLD, a part of the circulating TRX was deposited in the contract as collateral for the minting of USDDOLD. Due to its non-liquid nature, this part of the TRX was deducted from the total circulating supply. Now, because USDD is upgraded to USDD2.0, USDDOLD is destroyed, and the corresponding collateral assets are also released. The accounting method for the circulating supply of TRX has also been updated, and this part of the TRX is re-included in the circulation. It's just a change in the accounting method of TRX. There is no new issuance of TRX, nor does it involve any transfer of funds. The total supply of TRX remains unchanged.

  Previously, USDD adopted an "over-collateralization mechanism", that is, more TRX was locked up to issue fewer USDD. This part of the TRX has always existed and will not be destroyed. It somehow becomes the circulation of USDD on the TRON network. Because these TRX are locked, they will not be included in the TRX circulation in the API. Now, the upgrade of USDD has changed the mechanism, and the corresponding TRX has been released. This part of the TRX has also returned to circulation. Some well-known third-party monitoring platforms, such as CMC and Coingecko, all consider this to be a normal phenomenon. Also, the World Liberty Financial Company, which is related to President Trump, has purchased $2.6 million worth of TRX. Such a real-money purchase shows support and recognition. How can it be said that there is no support?

* Leem

  I think inflation and deflation don't matter. As long as it can be proved that the short-term and long-term annualized yields will not decrease, no one should object. This is just my personal opinion. In fact, no one cares about inflation or deflation. They only care about income.

* Wayne

  In fact, there are two types of income. One is the amount of TRX, the other is its price, and there is also the voting reward, right? But for the issuers of TRX, they can actually create billions of TRX out of thin air and participate in voting like the holders who pay for TRX. Their behavior must be different. In this way, any rational person who really wants to participate in staking and obtain rewards will not propose to reduce the TRX reward, right?

* Daniel

  Nowadays, TRX is actually produced by some SRs elected by the community. Well-known SRs like Binance and Google Cloud are all involved. The goal of TRON is getting closer and closer to complete decentralization. BTC, ETH, and TRX are all generated by consensus. Of course, the ecological economy and the token economy also have certain values. No BTC miner wants BTC to be reduced, but the halving of BTC has also brought huge value. This halving means that a public chain is gradually moving towards maturity. This is not only the correction of the economic model but also the manifestation of a more reasonable consensus mechanism.

  The token economy design and governance mechanism of mainstream blockchains have considered the balance of the inflation rate. For BTC, it is halved every 4 years, right? And for ETH, in 2021, EIP1599 was implemented, which is mainly used to quote the base fee and accelerate the burning. Then in 2022, the supply of ETH was greatly reduced, so that the inflation rate dropped from 4% to 0.3%, a decrease of about 90%. The supply rate of Solana is also preset. Currently, it is 5.1%, and it is planned to be reduced by about 15% every year.

  The current supply of TRON is already more than 5 years behind. Referring to the examples of the above-mentioned public chains, it is time to consider the appropriate supply of TRX and make adjustments to the parameters on the chain.

* Leem

  Should we also discuss a long-term effective mechanism similar to the halving of BTC to control the total supply of TRX? In this way, the community and users will have psychological expectations. A long-term plan is also a sign of the maturity and stability of a public chain, which can avoid a lot of criticism.

* Daniel

  I think this is possible. However, it is better to let the TRON DAO conduct precise calculations first and then have a full discussion in the community.

* Jake

  If there are no other questions, shall we call it a day?

  Okay, thank you all. Goodbye!
